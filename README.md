# Baade's Window Reddening and Extinction
Complimentary material from article: 

"MAPPING THE INTERSTELLAR REDDENING AND EXTINCTION TOWARDS BAADEâ€™S WINDOW USING MINIMUM LIGHT COLORS OF AB-TYPE RR LYRAE STARS. REVELATIONS FROM THE DE-REDDENED COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAMS" 
by A. Saha et al.

The contents in this repository are:

- Reddening map (B1reddeningmap.fits): Multiextension fits file with color excess information in the region in bins of 30 arcseconds in each coordinate. File contains WCS information encoding RA and DEC. Extension [1] has E(r-z) and extension [2] contains E(g-i)

- Lightcurves (lightcurves/): Lightcurves and best fitted template in ugriz for the 475 RR Lyrae stars of type ab used in this work. An example is seen in Figure 3 of the main paper.

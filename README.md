# Baade's Window Reddening and Extinction
Complimentary material from article: 

*"MAPPING THE INTERSTELLAR REDDENING AND EXTINCTION TOWARDS BAADEâ€™S WINDOW USING MINIMUM LIGHT COLORS OF AB-TYPE RR LYRAE STARS. REVELATIONS FROM THE DE-REDDENED COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAMS"*

by A. Saha et al.

The contents in this repository are:

- **Reddening map** (*B1reddeningmap.fits*): Multiextension fits file with map of color excess in the region in bins of 30 arcseconds in each coordinate. File contains WCS information encoding RA and DEC. The E(g-i) map is shown in Figure 12 of the main paper.
  1. Extension [1] = E(r-z) 
  2. Extension [2] = E(g-i)

- **Lightcurves** (*lightcurves/*): PDF files with lightcurves and best fitted template in ugriz for the 474 RR Lyrae stars of type ab used in this work. An example is seen in Figure 3 of the main paper.
